# Startpage

This is my personalized start page made in Flask with some cool functionalities:
* Show upcoming events from your Google Calendar
* Offers a command-line to search through various sites immediately or access to some handy urls

The colorscheme of the site is based in the current colorscheme of my computer, `colors.css` is generated automatically by [pywal](https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal).
